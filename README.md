# Term Project – [Short Project Title]

## Note to self:
-work in jupyter lab and go through conda to use the environment I set up for this for juypter lab
-use VS code to open the same project and do the git stuff there
-for this project want to learn how to use branches (Create just one feature branch for your “extra work” or “new analysis.”)

## Overview
Brief 2-3 sentence summary of the project goal and context.
The students enrolled in CSDS 413 will conduct a data analysis project throughout the semester.  The project teams will identify a question to be answered, develop a hypothesis, and perform data  analysis to test their hypothesis and answer the question they pose.

## Repository Structure
- /notebooks/ … exploratory & final analysis notebooks
- /scripts/ … helper Python scripts
- /data/ … raw and cleaned data (not tracked if large)
- /results/ … output CSVs and plots
- README.md … project documentation

## Usage
1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<project>.git`
2. Install dependencies:
